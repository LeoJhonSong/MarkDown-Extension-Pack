# Markown Extension Pack

This is a collection of extensions I use when writing Markdown files. I would be
glad if you are interested in this pack and just give a try! :thumbsup:

This pack includes:

- [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)
- [Reflow Markdown](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marvhen.reflow-markdown)
- [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
- [Markdown Emoji](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-emoji)
- [:emojisense:](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.emojisense)

If you find a extension really useful when developing python code and want to
improve this extension, feel free to [raise a issue](https://github.com/LeoJhonSong/MarkDown-Extension-Pack/issues).
But please notice that **issues using the extensions included in this pack**
will not be accepted in this extension pack's repository:sweat_smile:.

**Enjoy!**
