## My tricks

Here are some tricks!üòÑ

VSCode sometimes stucks when too many extensions are installed? Here are two
tricks:

1. Open the **Command Palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select **Developer: Open
   Process Explorer** to see which extensions cost most. Then disable (just
   workspace) some extensions you don't need in current workspace.
2. thinks disable extensions one by one too annoying? you can disable a group
   of extensions by simply disable **a extension pack**! ‚úåÔ∏è Another good news is
   that you can uninstall any extension included in the pack while this extension
   pack is still thereüéä
3. want to make your own extension pack? [This](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2017/03/07/extension-pack-roundup)
